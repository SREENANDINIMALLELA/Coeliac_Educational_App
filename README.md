# Coeliac_Educational_App
Coeliac Educational App - CodeClan JavaScript Group Project

An educational web app aimed at educating both parents and children about Coeliac's disease. It includes two main educational pages: one aimed at explaining the condition to children who have been diagnosed, and another at parents and other adults who are coming to understand their child's new dietary requirements and limitations. It also contains a restaurants page which displays local establishments that serve gluten-free options. Users can add their own suggestions, leave reviews and ratings, all of which are displayed on the page via a map with a sidebar for ratings and reviews. The map is populated by pins based on an API which converts submitted street addresses into usable coordinates.
