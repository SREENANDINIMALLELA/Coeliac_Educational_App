    <h1>We want to help you  take some of the stress out of going gluten free.</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>Gluten contamination or cross-contamination occurs when gluten free food comes into contact with food that does contain gluten. For someone diagnosed with Coeliac Disease or following a gluten free diet coming into contact with gluten can cause an adverse reaction</p>

    <div class="cross">
      <p>Reducing the risk of cross contamination in the home:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wipe surfaces after preparing foods containing gluten</li>
        <li>Cook gluten free food in separate pots and pans and serve with separate utensils</li>
        <li>Use separate containers for butter, jam etc. as knives can transfer crumbs from regular bread</li>
        <li>Use a separate toaster or toaster bags for gluten free bread, available from most major supermarkets</li>
        <li>Wash hands before handling gluten free food, especially after other food preparation</li>
        <li>Use seperate chopping boards for gluten products</li>
        <li>Store gluten free foods on the top shelve/drawers of fridges and freezers to stop gluten crumbs from falling in the food.</li>
        <li>Wash hands before handling gluten free food, especially after other food preparation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="out">
    <p>When you are out and about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep a few gluten free snacks, in your car or handbag for any time of day</li>
      <li>If your holiday involves a flight, try to pre-arrange a gluten free meal</li>
      <li>When eating out explain your situation to waiting staff and ask them if they can <br> check the ingredients of dishes with the chef</li>
      <li>If your child is going to a friends house to play or a party, speak with the host they might be able <li> to prepare foods for your child but if in doubt offer to help or take your own foods.</li>
